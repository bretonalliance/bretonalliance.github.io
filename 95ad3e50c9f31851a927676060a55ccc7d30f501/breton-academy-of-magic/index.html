        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Every August, Breton Academy of Magic (BAM) welcomes 16 new students to its hallways. These students are personally selected and invited by Breton Alliance’s Academy Recruitment Officers. BAM provides an inclusive learning environment that prepares students for meaningful personal lives, professional accomplishments, and responsible global citizenship. We foster a collaborative learning among students, faculty, and staff and continue to integrate the liberal arts and sciences with professional and magical studies.</p>
        <p>Within our six-year program at BAM, our students will be given the opportunity to harness their magic’s capabilities, continue their general education, and train physically, emotionally, mentally. Our students will graduate from BAM prepared to handle the ups-and-downs of both Breton’s magical community, and the world outside of Alderville.</p>
        <p>BAM’s mission states the following:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Breton Academy of Magic is dedicated to producing well-rounded, critically-thinking, and productive members of the magical community. We take pride in our ability to offer top-notch education and training that will benefit our students for the remainder of their life. We promise to practice <strong>honesty</strong>, maintain <strong>integrity</strong>, and stand <strong>united</strong> when we come across challenges.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Welcome to Alderville, home of Breton Academy of Magic. We have a feeling you’ll love it here as much as we do.</p>

        <h2 id="maps-and-grounds">Maps and Grounds</h2>
        <p>Breton Academy of Magic (BAM) is made up of several core buildings, which are connected by several covered tunnels and an assortment of underground tunnels. For the most part, unless required, usage of underground tunnels is forbidden to students, as they are technically a part of Breton Alliance, Inc.</p>
        <p>Breton’s campus is made up of BAM, BAI Headquarters, and the Breton Transportation Center. The campus also contains close to four square miles of land, where nobody outside of the magical community resides. This extra land is to provide an audio and visual barrier between Breton and the outside world.</p>
        <p>Here’s a labeled map showcasing the campus.</p>
        <div class="text-center">
          <a href="../images/bam-labeled-map.jpeg" width="" title="BAM map" data-lightbox="BAM">

          </a>
        </div>
        <p>There’s a privacy gate that lines the entire Breton campus property. This helps prevent strangers from wandering through to our campus. There’s one main gate where everybody enters and exits the campus, and we have staff there posted between the hours of 7am and 8pm daily. Between those hours are the only time that people can enter and exit the campus, unless it is a state of emergency.</p>
        <p>The entire outdoor campus is available to all students to explore, hike, and spend time in. Unless there’s a building or sign that says students aren’t allowed, it’s open to the public Breton community.</p>

        <p>All BAI underground tunnels, rooms, and areas are forbidden to students unless told otherwise. Please follow the following rule of thumb: “If your Breton badge won’t let you in, you don’t belong there.” The exception is Health Services, which is located in the basement underneath the Training Center.

        <p>The Breton campus has a curfew of 8pm daily every night. After 8pm at night, students, faculty, and staff will not be able to enter or exit the campus, except in a state of emergency. The curfew is lifted each morning at 7am.</p>
        <p>The BAM buildings have a curfew of 10pm each night, even during holidays and summers, meaning all students, faculty, and staff must be indoors by 10pm each night. The curfew is lifted at 6am the following morning. BAM students’ final curfew is 12am midnight; this is when all public spaces close for the evening, if they were not already closed. The Student Residence Faculty are in charge of enforcing these curfews.</p>

        <p>All faculty live full-time at Breton Alliance, although they are technically employed by BAM. Each faculty member was either a student of BAM or of Roteland Magician’s Academy (or one of their institutions). All faculty members possess their own imprint, which they’ve studied and refined. Their position at BAM was offered specifically targeted to each individual’s unique qualities and skills. Each professor attended an additional five years of schooling before becoming a fully-qualified professor. Each faculty member of BAM is valued, appreciated, and respected. Please treat every faculty member with respect and dignity, no matter what their role is at BAM.</p>
        <p>For a full list of the current BAM faculty and staff, please view the <a href="/95ad3e50c9f31851a927676060a55ccc7d30f501/bam-faculty-roster/">Faculty Roster</a>.</p>

        <p>Each year of students goes through classes together. Therefore, the peers that a student works with as a first year will be the peers they’ll work with throughout their time at Breton Academy of Magic. This allows students to form close bonds with classmates, understand how they work together, and to form trust.</p>
        <p>All of our classes last one semester (approximately 16 weeks). Each class except magic is attended two times per week, either on Monday and Thursday or Tuesday and Friday (what we call A and B days respectively). Every student has one magic class per semester as well, which they’ll attend four times a week, on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. Lastly, each student has one free period time slot, which is provided as a chance for students to study or train.</p>
        <p>On Wednesdays, students participate in workshops. Each student will attend one workshop in the morning and one in the afternoon. The workshops are blended classes with three years of students and three teachers all in one space together. This is a chance for students to go in depth with their magic, expand their own skills, and learn how their magic works with others’ magic.</p>
        <p>Detailed class schedules are distributed to all students the first week of each semester, however, you can see a list of all the classes a BAM student takes and which professor teaches them on the <a href="/95ad3e50c9f31851a927676060a55ccc7d30f501/bam-student-classes/">Student Classes list</a>.</p>

Our professors do have lectures, but encourage conversation-based learning, combined with a hands-on approach to experimentation. Although students may have reading assignments as homework to prepare for discussions or debates, none of our classes are based on homework or exams. A student won’t necessarily receive a lower score just because they didn’t complete a reading assignment. However, if a student’s lack of completion of assignments results in their group discussion being unsuccessful, then it may impact their score in more ways than one.</p>
        <p>All students will receive a letter grade (‘E’xemplary, ‘S’atisfactory, ‘A’verage, ‘P’oor) for each course they take, but they will be assigned based on participation, respectfulness, and whether the student demonstrated a drive for discovery and learning. Please remember that by missing classes and/or receiving lower scores, the only person that a student hurts is themselves. The scores students receive impact the rest of their academics at BAM, as well as potential job offers upon graduation.</p>
        <p>We do recommend that students bring paper and pencils or pens to each class to take notes. Whatever is discussed during class or said during a lecture may be helpful later in the course. This is particularly true in mathematics courses, which do have classwork that is assigned and expected to be finished.</p>
        <p>Our professors don’t take regular attendance, however, since each course has no more than sixteen students, it makes it easy to tell if somebody doesn’t show up for class. If a student continues to be absent, then their grade (as a result of lower class participation) may suffer. All classes at BAM move quickly… missing more than two classes in a row results in a significantly reduced understanding of the material that may last the remainder of the course.</p>
        <p>All students must complete their own work in class and outside of class. Any cheating or plagiarism is grounds for immediately expulsion. Students may talk to each other about readings, assignments, or lectures to further gain clarity on the lesson, but students should remember that the purpose of each class is to let students formulate their own opinions and perspectives, not to use each others’.</p>

        </div>
        <h3 id="magic">Magic</h3>
        <p>Students will attend Magic classes twice a week, as well as a Magic workshop on each Wednesday. Normal magic classes will take place in a classroom, but workshops will always take place in the Auditorium. Students will learn not just about their magic, but also about the history of the magic community, where their magical roots come from, what types of things the community does with magic, and what the students’ place is in the magical world.</p>
        <p>Students will be given the chance to expand their magical abilities and to push themselves to the limit in a controlled environment. Students will also get to work with each other, forming a unique bond and trust between classmates. Students will get the opportunity to learn how their powers work together, eventually getting to place where each students’ natural skills and capabilities are exemplified and maximized when they work as a team.</p>

          <a id="physical-training">&nbsp;</a>
        </div>
        <h3 id="physical-skills-training">Physical Skills Training</h3>
        <p>Every student will attend a normal Physical Skills Training course twice a week, as well as a Physical Skills Training workshop each Wednesday. These will focus on physical strength, dexterity, flexibility, and endurance. These courses are not competitions, but rather an opportunity for every student to become the best versions of themselves.</p>
        <p>Some training sessions will allow students to utilize their imprints. Not only is Physical Skills Training a chance for students to be active and stay healthy physically, but it’s also an opportunity for students to learn more about their imprint in a safe and controlled environment. Physical Skills Training and the corresponding workshop gives students a chance to use their magic in an active way. Even if an imprint isn’t directly physical by nature, students will be given the opportunity to learn how to use their magic in a physical capacity.</p>
        <p>Each student has their own small locker in the Training Center locker rooms. Students are given access to their locker within their first few days at BAM. A students’ locker will remain their locker for the next six years at BAM. The locker rooms all contain bathrooms, showers, changing areas, and weight scales for use by the students. Although there are no cameras in the locker rooms, there are audio recorders for safety reasons. Even what’s said in the locker rooms is not a secret.</p>
        <p>Physical Skills Training classes will start promptly 10 minutes after typical class start time and end 10 minutes early to allow students ample time to change into either their training uniform or their normal uniform. This is not enough time for students to run back to dormitory rooms to retrieve forgotten uniform items; students may either carry their training uniform with them for the morning/afternoon, or may keep them in their locker until it’s convenient to pick them up. The exception is workshops, which will begin and end exactly on the time it states on the students’ schedule. Students may have to participate in swimming as part of their physical training. Students will given notice in advance of when this will happen so they know to bring a swimsuit instead of the typical training uniform.</p>

        <h2 id="uniform">Uniform</h2>
        <p>All students at BAM must wear a standard uniform when attending classes and training in class groups. Uniforms are given to students free of charge, but students must provide their measurements to BAM in advance to guarantee the clothing provided will be ready at the start of term. If parts of the uniform need replacing at any point, we encourage students to reach out to the Student Residence Faculty with any questions or concerns.</p>
        <p>The uniform provided consists of the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>5 white button-down shirts</li>
          <li>2 black jackets</li>
          <li>4 black pants or skorts (in any combination desired)</li>
          <li>4 blue t-shirts for physical training</li>
          <li>4 grey shorts for physical training</li>
          <li>4 blue Breton swimsuits for physical training</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Students are asked to bring their own shoes, but we recommend the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>2+ pairs of everyday shoes</li>
          <li>1 pair of <em>indoor-only</em> training shoes</li>
          <li>1 pair of shower-shoes</li>
          <li>1 pair of winter boots</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Students may bring their own clothing to wear when not attending classes or training with a class. Please note that by default, each student only has one dresser with three drawers, one trunk, and one desk with a lockable drawer for storage.</p>
        <p>Here’s an idea of what our BAM uniforms look like:</p>

        <p>The six Student Residence Faculty members live and work within BAM’s walls. In fact, the residence faculty are the only BAI/BAM staff to have above-ground living quarters. The living quarters are single rooms with private bathrooms, and all six Student Residence Faculty members share a laundry facility and lounge.</p>
        <p>The Student Residence Faculty’s living quarters are on the second and third floor, above the building section labeled “BAM Shoppe and Auditorium”. The residence faculty members all work in a shared office on the main floor of the same area. In fact, the only staircase (except in an emergency) to get to the living quarters is within the shared office, helping to give them separation and solitude away from students.</p>

        </div>
        <h3 id="student-lounge-and-dining">Student Lounge and Dining</h3>
        <p>The Student Lounge is the primary hangout space for students. The lounge and dining space is three stories, with its own staircase inside the lounge, although there are doors on every floor.</p>
        <p>The bottom floor of the lounge is for dining. This is where all meals are served and eaten. The middle floor contains games, couches, music, tables for group studying, and mailboxes. There is also a television which has video games, a DVD player (with a large DVD library), and video streaming. The TV does not get cable or news channels. The top floor of the lounge is for quieter work, and is primarily a space for individual and small group studying.</p>
        <p>The student lounge is open all hours between 6am–12am midnight. Like the rest of the rooms in BAM, students may only access the lounge with their Breton badge.</p>
        <p>All meals are served buffet-style. Although food is available to all students between the hours of 6am–12am midnight, three core meals are served on the following schedule:</p>

        </div>
        <h3 id="student-dormitories">Student Dormitories</h3>
        <p>The Student Dormitories are made up of 24 rooms of four students each. The rooms are spread over three floors, with eight rooms per floor. Each floor has four restrooms/showers (two for females, two for males), and two laundry facilities (laundry machines are placed inside restrooms). We have no hard-set rules about who utilizes which restroom/shower facilities. Any student may choose to use any facility they desire. Our guidelines are the male-designated ones have urinals, the female-designated ones don’t.</p>
        <p>Here’s a LEGO demo of what a third-floor room looks like:</p>
        <div class="text-center">

        </div>
        <p>Students are only allowed into their specific dormitory room. Each room has an RFID scanner, and only Breton badges belonging to residents of that room are allowed into the room.</p>
        <p>Students are automatically assigned roommates their first year at BAM, but roommate switches are allowed at any time, pending approval from all roommates involved in the switch and permission from the Student Residence Faculty. The specific dormitory room a student is assigned to will stay the same throughout all six years at BAM. This enables students to leave belongings at BAM during the holidays and summers. So when you move into BAM, get comfortable… this will be your home for the next six years.</p>
        <p>Each dormitory room also contains an advanced technology called a ScreenMate. The screenmate runs on a plain television, ScreenMate itself is an advanced computer system designed for telecommunication, broadcasting, and calls between other ScreenMates. These are used to broadcast messages throughout the campus, and can also be used to call other dormitory rooms. Although ScreenMates contain cameras and microphones, BAM promises that we will not record or video dormitory rooms and students without permission. Students will know if their ScreenMate is using the camera or the microphone from a flashing red light on the bottom left corner; if the light is flashing, a microphone or camera is on, if the light is not flashing, then microphones and cameras are all disabled.</p>
        <p>BAM provides four towels, two washcloths, two hand-towels, two sets of sheets, two pillows, four pillowcases, and one comforter per student. Washing these are at the responsibility of the student. However, students must provide their own soaps, shampoos, robes, and hygiene items. BAM provides laundry detergent, fabric softener, stain remover, and dryer sheets, but students must provide a clothes hamper. Use of the laundry facilities is free, and accessible via a student’s Breton badge. We ask students to set timers and to remain prompt when using machines to remain courteous to others. Students will get a notification on their ScreenMate when laundry loads are done.</p>

        <h3 id="activities-and-spare-time">Activities and Spare Time</h3>
        <p>While BAM doesn’t provide any formal extracurricular activities, many students form clubs and groups within their interests to have fun when they’re not training and studying.</p>
        <p>Students may use any classrooms, the library, the training gymnasium, the pool, the auditorium, the student lounge, and the Breton campus to their leisure, unless the area is in use or reserved for another purpose. The only areas off-limits are the BAI underground tunnels, faculty residences and offices, and any area of the campus clearly labeled as off-limits to students. A good rule of thumb is “If your Breton badge won’t let you in, you don’t belong there.”</p>
        <p>The Student Residence Faculty are responsible for monitoring the clubs and activities, and they may recruit any BAM faculty and staff to assist them. Clubs and activities are not allowed to be exclusionary; any club or activity found to be bullying, intentionally excluding, or abusing their power may be disbanded by the Student Residence Faculty.</p>

Students have 48 hours to pick up packages/oversized mail before they’re returned to the sender.</p>

        <p>By intentional design, the entire Breton campus has no Wi-Fi or cellular signal. Mobile phones, computers, tablets, etc, will <em>not</em> be able to connect to the internet while on the Breton campus. Students may use their devices responsibly in an offline mode, but please be mindful of the fact that our goal at BAM is to engage with other students and faculty, to study and refine natural imprinted skills, and to become better magicians, <em>not</em> to have fun playing video games.</p>
        <p>However, to allow students to moderately connect with the outside world, the library contains 24 computers which are connected to a special form of wired internet. Each student will have their own account on the computer system, accessed by a Breton badge scan and either a fingerprint or face ID scan. Each student is allowed to use their account with an internet connection for up to 30 minutes per day. This should be enough time to check emails, communicate with family, and do small research assignments. If needed, students may ask librarians for an extension for a specific day. Certain websites that are deemed not appropriate may be blocked.</p>
        <p>Tampering with any BAM computers or electronic devices is strictly prohibited, and there will be consequences if students are found meddling with BAM technology.</p>

        <p>BAM Students are not allowed to park and keep cars on campus. However, to provide students flexibility and independence, the Breton Transportation Center allows all students of legal driving age to rent and use cars and vehicles free of charge, as long as students obtain their own Driver’s License (belonging to any U.S. state), provide their own insurance, and pay for gas and any damages. For students who are under legal driving age or who wish to not drive, Breton provides shuttle services from the campus to Alderville and back regularly.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, because of the secretive nature of Breton and the magical community, guests and visitors who are not imprinted are not allowed on the Breton campus. Any guests or visitors who wish to enter the campus will not be allowed into the campus unless BAM and BAI are aware of their arrival in advance, and the guests and fully approved to enter the campus.</p>
        <p>Guests and visitors are not allowed to utilize BAM’s shuttle service or the Transportation Center’s renting service. All guests and visitors must drive or walk themselves into the campus to increase security. All Breton staff members are aware of the policies and will enforce them. There is a designated BAM visitor parking lot, and we ask all guests to the campus use that lot to park in.</p>
        <p>Campus security, Breton Transporation Center security, and the gate staff are in charge of enforcing these rules, and exceptions will only be made in case of an emergency.</p>
