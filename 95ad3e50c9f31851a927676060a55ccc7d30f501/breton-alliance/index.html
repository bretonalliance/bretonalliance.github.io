        </div>
        <h2 id="you-are-an-employee">You are an Employee</h2>
        <p>If you decide to join us at BAI after finishing your education with BAM, you will not just be an addition to the team. You’ll also be an employee. Therefore, we offer competitive salaries, insurance, and benefits.</p>
        <div id="anchor">
          <a id="pay">&nbsp;</a>
        </div>
        <h3 id="pay">Pay</h3>
        <p>All employees are offered an annual salary of between $15k and $28k. Although this may not seem like a lot, it actually adds up once you factor in the insurance offers and benefits. This is paid on a bi-weekly basis; every other Friday is payday. It will sent to each employee via direct deposit.</p>
        <div id="anchor">
          <a id="insurance">&nbsp;</a>
        </div>
        <h3 id="insurance">Insurance</h3>
        <p>All employees are offered insurance options, although they are not required. However, all insurance options are completely free for employed persons—not spouses or children. Employees may pay out of pocket to add on any insurance offers for family members the prices for out of pocket insurance is included. If an employee opts to not accept any insurance offers, they will <em>not</em> see an increase in salary. The insurance provided includes the following:</p>
        <div id="anchor">
          <a id="auto-insurance">&nbsp;</a>
        </div>
        <h4 id="auto-insurance">Auto Insurance</h4>
        <p>We attempt to make our auto insurance as clear, transparent, and simple as possible. Auto insurance includes a $500 collision and comprehensive deductible, liability and personal injury protection up to $1M, and $250 roadside assistance deductible. BAI’s auto insurance includes BAI-owned vehicles and personal owned vehicles.</p>
        <p>If a person is not an employee of BAI, the annual cost of auto insurance is $800.</p>
        <div id="anchor">
          <a id="health-insurance">&nbsp;</a>
        </div>
        <h4 id="health-insurance">Health Insurance</h4>
        <p>Within BAI’s walls, BAI will cover all medical bills, including dental appointments, cost of glasses/contacts, and therapy appointments at 100%. Essentially, for the BAI employee, any services offered and required are completely free. Outside of BAI (what we consider “external health insurance”), we offer privatized insurance options.</p>
        <p>BAI’s external health insurance offer includes full health, dental, vision, and mental benefits. Health insurance covers a $500 deductible per year, which covers all four categories listed. For any check-up, dental appointment, vision appointment, glasses, or therapy costs, the employee will pay full price out of pocket up until they reach the out of pocket maximum: $500. At that point, BAI will cover all costs at 100%. Although our health insurance cards say the plan is “PPO”, that’s just for formality. For BAI employees, this health insurance offer is completely free.</p>
        <p>If a person is not an employee of BAI, the annual cost of health insurance is $2000 and <em>does not</em> include internal health options.</p>
        <div id="anchor">
          <a id="add-insurance">&nbsp;</a>
        </div>
        <h4 id="add-insurance">AD&amp;D Insurance</h4>
        <p>BAI offers AD&amp;D insurance to all employees. This will be used to pay an employee’s beneficiaries in case of accidental death or dismemberment (loss of limbs, vision, hearing) where the employee can no longer perform their job duties. The AD&amp;D insurance offer is for $50k in a lump sum.</p>
        <p>This insurance is not offered for non-employees.</p>
        <div id="anchor">
          <a id="life-insurance">&nbsp;</a>
        </div>
        <h4 id="life-insurance">Life Insurance</h4>
        <p>BAI offers short-term and long-term life insurance options.</p>
        <p>The short-term life insurance is for if an employee is injured and is unable to perform their job duties. After receiving the injury or falling ill, there is a seven day waiting period, and then, upon a note from BAI’s Health Services, the employee will receive 100% of their annual income for up to 90 days, or until they are able to work again, whichever is shorter.</p>
        <p>After 90 days is complete, if the employee is still unable to perform their job duties, upon an additional note from BAI’s Health Services, the employee will begin to receive 80% of their income until they are able to work again. This is BAI’s long-term insurance. Long-term payments will either last until the employee is able to work again or until they reach age 65, whichever is shorter. The employee receiving long-term insurance payments must continue to be checked out by BAI’s Health Services every 6 months, to verify long-term eligibility status. If the employee’s disability or injury lasts longer than two years, they will automatically begin to receive 50% of their annual income.</p>
        <p>This insurance is not offered for non-employees.</p>
        <div id="anchor">
          <a id="benefits">&nbsp;</a>
        </div>
        <h3 id="benefits">Benefits</h3>
        <p>BAI also offers an array of benefits to all employees. Similar to insurance offers, any employee who opts to not accept any benefits will <em>not</em> see an increase in salary, although all benefits are free of charge.</p>
        <div id="anchor">
          <a id="room-and-board">&nbsp;</a>
        </div>
        <h4 id="room-and-board">Room and Board</h4>
        <p>All employees of BAI are offered full room and board options at BAI, although no employees are required to live, eat, and stay at BAI. Living options at BAI are <em>only</em> for the employee, so spouses and family members are not allowed to live at BAI (and remember, only imprinted persons are allowed to visit).</p>
        <p>BAI offers single, double, and quadruple room options, usually depending on the person’s preference and their job role. All agents are required to share a double room with their partner, and certain teams in Recruitment and Control Center are required to share a quadruple room with their team.</p>
        <p>Besides the job requirements listed above, employees may request room changes at any time. The following situations are the only exceptions to the rooming requirements listed above:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Married couples where both partners are imprinted</li>
          <li>Families of married couples where both parents are imprinted</li>
        </ul>
        <p>All of our rooms at BAI are underground, except some of the staff of BAM. Therefore, no rooms have windows, but all have ample lighting with backup power supplies.</p>
        <p>Here’s a LEGO demo of what a third-floor room looks like:</p>
        <div class="text-center">

          </a>
        </div>
        <p>All employees are offered free food and beverages in the BAI cafeteria. This is included for employees who are taking advantage of BAI’s room and board offers, and those who are not. Please see below for more information about food and living while at BAI.</p>
        <div id="anchor">
          <a id="401k-options">&nbsp;</a>
        </div>
        <h4 id="401k-options">401k Options</h4>
        <p>BAI offers a generous 401k offer. Employees may put money from their salary directly into a 401k. Any employee contributions will be matched 100% up to 3% of the employee’s total income. Employees may utilize either a pre-tax 401k or a Roth (post-tax) 401k, but all company matches will automatically go into the pre-tax 401k.</p>
        <div id="anchor">
          <a id="paid-time-off">&nbsp;</a>
        </div>
        <h4 id="paid-time-off">Paid Time Off</h4>
        <p>All BAI employees are offered a generous five weeks of vacation days per calendar year (25 days). However, depending on the person’s job and responsibilities at BAI, there may be limitations as to <em>when</em> employees may take time off.</p>
        <p>Sick days are not included in the vacation time count, and are unlimited.</p>
        <p>Additionally, the following U.S. holidays are BAI holidays and do not count in the vacation time count:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>New Years Day (January 1)</li>
          <li>MLK Day (third Monday of January)</li>
          <li>President’s Day (third Monday of February)</li>
          <li>Memorial Day (last Monday of May)</li>
          <li>Juneteenth (June 19)</li>
          <li>Independence Day (July 4)</li>
          <li>Labor Day (first Monday of September)</li>
          <li>Thanksgiving Day (last Thursday of November)</li>
          <li>Day after Thanksgiving (last Friday of November)</li>
          <li>Winter Holiday (December 24)</li>
          <li>Winter Holiday (December 25)</li>
          <li>New Years Eve (December 31)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If any holidays fall on a Saturday or Sunday, BAI will give a corresponding Monday or Friday off, in addition to the holiday itself (for those employees that work on weekends). The only exception to time off on holidays is for agents that are actively deployed and Control Center employees who are managing deployed agents. For these folks, they will be given appropriate days off after their missions are complete.</p>
        <div id="anchor">
          <a id="uniform">&nbsp;</a>
        </div>
        <h3 id="uniform">Uniform</h3>
        <p>Although BAI doesn’t <em>enforce</em> a uniform most of the time, for special occasions, we ask our employees to dress in a formal manner. This would include for special meetings and/or guest visits. Therefore, BAI provides the following for all employees:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>2 purple BAI shirts</li>
          <li>2 black jackets</li>
          <li>2 black pants or skorts (in any combination desired)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additionally, the following is available for extra purchase for those who desire:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Purple t-shirts for physical training</li>
          <li>Grey shorts for physical training</li>
          <li>Purple Breton swimsuits for physical training</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Employees are asked to bring their own shoes, but we ask that all employees wear <em>indoor-only</em> shoes when training.</p>
        <p>In general, BAI has no issue with employees bringing and wearing their own clothing for all activities, unless required by their job or during special occasions, as stated above.</p>
        <p>Here’s an idea of what our BAI uniforms and clothing offers look like:</p>
