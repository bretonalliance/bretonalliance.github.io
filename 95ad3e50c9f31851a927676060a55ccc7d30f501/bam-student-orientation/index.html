        <p>Our recruitment staff should’ve given you a personalized copy of our new student invitation letter. However, if you need to download, view, or print a new copy to gain entry to our Academy (first years only), please obtain a new copy <a href="../resources/BAM%20Generic%20Invitation.pdf">here</a>.</p>

        <p>One large coach bus with enough space for all 96 students and their luggage will depart from Bangor International Airport promptly at 11:30am. Returning students must bring their Breton Badge and be ready to scan it in order to obtain entry to the bus. New students must bring a photo ID plus a paper invitation to gain entry to the bus.</p>
        <p>Please arrive to the bus no later than 11:15am in order to get your luggage boarded and to get settled in for the drive up to Alderville.</p>
        <p>The bus will not be stopping for any reason other than a technical emergency. Please bring your lunch as needed on the bus with you. Please be courteous about which foods your bring on the bus. The bus will have a bathroom on board.</p>
        <p>The bus will <em>not</em> be branded with Breton’s logos or colors. Please head for the bus parking, and look for a single sign with BAM’s logo.</p>

        <h3 id="300pm-arrival-to-breton-academy-of-magic">3:00pm: Arrival to Breton Academy of Magic</h3>
        <p>Welcome to Breton Academy of Magic! All students are asked to please leave your luggage on the bottom of the bus. Please bring any “carry-on” items with you inside. Our staff will remove your luggage for you, and bring it to your dormitory rooms. The staff will leave your luggage outside in the hall next to your door.</p>
        <p>Returning students are now free to enjoy your weekend. The only rule is that you may not come into the Dining Hall until 7pm on Saturday or the Auditorium until 6pm on Saturday.</p>
        <p>New students are asked to proceed directly to the Auditorium for your official welcome.</p>
        <div id="anchor">

        </div>
        <h3 id="310pm-official-new-student-welcome">3:10pm: Official New Student Welcome</h3>
        <p>The Headmasters and Junior Headmasters will take this opportunity to welcome all new students to BAM. This will take place promptly in the Auditorium at 3:10pm (to give students a chance to move from the bus to the Auditorium). There are bathrooms located right outside the Auditorium that may be used, but because new students won’t have much time, we advise all students use the restroom on the bus as they approach the school.</p>
        <div id="anchor">
          <a id="330pm-breakout-sessions">&nbsp;</a>
        </div>
        <h3 id="330pm-breakout-sessions">3:30pm: Breakout Sessions</h3>
        <p>All students will be broken up into three groups (one group of six, two groups of five). Each group will rotate through three stations, each station lasting 45 minutes and beginning and ending at the Auditorium.</p>
        <h4 id="student-residence-faculty-session">Student Residence Faculty Session</h4>
        <p>This session is a chance for new students to meet the Student Residence Faculty. They’ll help all new students obtain their new Breton Badge, and take an overview tour of the Residence area at Breton. Students will also be allowed to visit their dormitory for the first time, and to set down their “carry-on” belongings and bring in their luggage.</p>
        <h4 id="bam-shoppe-session">BAM Shoppe Session</h4>
        <p>This session is a chance for new students to learn more about the BAM Shoppe. The BAM Shoppe is a student’s one-stop shop for every single material item they could ask for while at school. School supplies, soaps and shampoos, even hangers, blankets, and pillows are available at the BAM Shoppe. In particular, this is a chance for all students to get fitted for your new uniforms, and to pick out any last-minute school supplies or personal items that may have been left at home.</p>
        <p>The BAM Shoppe normally closes at 5pm, but on this opening weekend, they’ll remain open until 6:30pm.</p>
        <h4 id="breton-campus-tour-session">Breton Campus Tour Session</h4>
        <p>With two Headmasters and a member of Breton’s campus staff, new students will take a driving tour through the Breton outdoor campus. Students won’t be asked to walk around at all. This tour should serve as a chance for students to see the area that they go to school in. They’ll have more opportunities to explore on their own later as the school year starts.</p>

        <p>At this point, all Breakout Sessions will return to the Auditorium. The Headmasters will meet once more with all of the new students, and will finish the first day closing.</p>
        <p>At this point, all students are free to do as they choose for 30 minutes. Students may go back to their dormitories to unpack, pick up any last items from the BAM Shoppe, or explore the school. But, this free time only lasts 30 minutes, so there’s not much time to get lost anywhere.</p>

        <p>At 6:15pm, all new students will meet in the Dining Hall. You will be sorted based on your dormitory rooms, and you, with your new roommates, will be introduced to your BAM Orientation Leader (OLs). This is a sixth year student who has volunteered to help answer your questions, get to know you, and be your guide for the rest of the weekend.</p>
        <p>Your OL will guide each set of roommates through various Icebreaker exercises and conversations aimed at the four of you getting to know one another better.</p>

        <p>At 7pm, all students (returning and new) are welcome to join the Dining Hall for dinner. Our special Breton welcoming meal will be served. This is also a chance for returning and new students to discuss dietary needs and restrictions with our kitchen staff for future meals.</p>
        <p>Usually, meals are open seating; anyone may sit at any table. However, for this weekend, all meals will have specially designated first year seating, where first years can eat with all of the OLs. First years are encouraged to take advantage of the mealtimes to continue to get to know one another.</p>

        <p>After dinner is complete, first year students will meet in the Dining Hall once again with their OL. At this point, OLs may choose what they’d like to do. Some have done haunted nighttime tours of the Breton campus or BAM building. Some have done a movie night. Some have done board games.</p>
        <p>We ask that returning students give right of way to all new students and their OLs, especially when it comes to use of the Dining Hall and Lounge space.</p>
        <p>All students must adhere to normal <a href="/95ad3e50c9f31851a927676060a55ccc7d30f501/breton-academy-of-magic/#hours-of-operation">curfew rules and hours of operation</a>.</p>

        <p>Please make sure all students are in the proper uniform by the start of classes on Monday morning. The uniform is typically black jacket, black pants or skort, and white button-down. The only exception is for Physical Skills Training and/or Workshop, in which case the uniform is grey shorts and a blue t-shirt with <em>indoor-only</em> training shoes. Your training instructor will indicate when to bring a swimsuit.</p>
