        <h1>Congratulations!</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="page-body">
        <p>You have been accepted to become one of the newest students of Breton Academy of Magic (also known as BAM), located in Alderville, Maine!</p>
        <p>We would like to wish you the warmest of welcomes as you join the Breton family. However, before you begin learning about us, our home, and our purpose, we would like to give you a brief introduction and summary of why you’re here.</p>
        <p>BAM is an elite educational institution for those Breton Alliance, Inc. (BAI) has determined to possess unique magical powers. These magical powers (sometimes referred to as “imprinted powers” or “imprints”) are indicated by a unqiue marking developing on a human’s body around the time of early puberty. The imprinted marking itself will typically finish developing around the age of 13 in females and 15 in males, and may or may not contain enough magic to become full powers. A person’s powers usually finish developing around the age of 15 in females and 17 in males, even if the person is still learning how to harness and use their powers well beyond the age of 20. This imprint could look like a unique tattoo or Henna marking, but they’ve been known to also look like weirdly shaped moles. They’re not harmful, and they don’t cause any pain.</p>
        <p>You may have noticed such a marking appearing on your body yourself, and possibly even noticed abnormal things happening that you seem to be controlling, but have no idea how they’ve occurred… don’t worry, that’s nothing unusual for those who have been imprinted.</p>
        <p>Receiving an imprinted power is exceptionally rare—approximately 70 people are imprinted in North America <em>per year</em>, and further, only 40–50 imprints actually contain enough magic to become a fully-fledged power. That’s about 0.0012%, if you want a more accurate number. So, if you’ve been imprinted, you’re <em>very</em> special. To add to your unique qualities, only 16 students are brought to BAM each year, meaning if you’ve been invited to attend BAM, you unknowingly competed against all 40–50 other imprinted teenagers. Every invited student has been hand-selected by BAI.</p>
        <p>To receive an invitation to BAM, a student must fulfill three categories:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The student must already have the basics of an imprinted power which has already begun developing, and the imprint must contain enough magic to become a full magical power.</li>
          <li>The student must be hard working, and their passion, intelligence, and determination has already been shown in previous school records—yes, we have access to those, too. BAI must fully believe the student will succeed at BAM and in the magical world, and will be able to provide their own motivation to work hard, attend classes, and keep practicing magic.</li>
          <li>BAI has reasonable belief that the student <em>and</em> their powers will be beneficial for BAM and BAI going forward, and will positively impact the magical community.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Typically, eight females and eight males are admitted to BAM each year, but we do not invite or discriminate against students based on their sex, gender, race, religious affiliations, sexual identity, sexual attraction, or any other trait. When required, we adjust housing accommodations accordingly, and we have a zero tolerance policy for bullying, assault, and discrimination.</p>
        <p>After you complete your six year education at BAM, there’s several different paths graduates typically take. The most common one is to begin working for BAI. This could be as one of our agents, a trainer, a professor at one of the Academies, a manager, a mission director, etc. There’s lots of job opportunities every year, and any person who has completed any magical Academy education (not just at BAM) is welcome at any of our BAI locations, although the specific job opportunities offered may differ based on the students’ performance, specific imprinted power, and availability. All BAI employees are paid for their service, and are offered full room and board at one of the BAI locations.</p>
        <p>Graduates may also choose to leave the Breton family, opting instead to return to non-magic society outside of the Breton world. Although this path is acceptable, graduates may find it difficult to qualify for work outside of magic, since they’ve been removed from the typical educational path since the 9th grade. However, BAM offers a complete liberal arts education that would prepare all of its students well for life outside of the magical community. If students do choose to do this, they may return to BAI at any time… after all, they finished their Academy education just like everybody else.</p>
        <p>In short, by accepting enrollment at Breton Academy of Magic, you’re also accepting a place in the Breton family, as well as a place in the magical community outside of our own small town. As long as you work hard, maintain your integrity and honesty, and work as a team player, you’ll have a home in the BAM and BAI community for the rest of your life.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, welcome to Breton Academy of Magic. We hope you come to love working and studying with us as much as we love having you. Together, we can make the world a better place.</p>
