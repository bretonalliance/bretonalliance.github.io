      <div class="page-body">
        <p>The roots of Breton Academy of Magic (BAM) and Breton Alliance, Inc. (BAI) are from the original Roteland Magical Committee (RMC), which originated in the East Midlands of England in 1351. It was there that the RMC began the first Academy for imprinted individuals: Roteland Magician’s Academy. The Academy began educating and training students in 1382, and still invites a maximum of 20 students each year to study in its historical halls.</p>

          <a class="photoswipe" href="../images/committee-map.png" target="_blank" data-pswp-width="1635" data-pswp-height="1003">
            <img class="image" src="../images/committee-map.png" width="500" alt="Roteland Magical Committe in England" />
            <div class="invisible caption">Roteland Magical Committe in England</div>
          </a>
        </div>
        <p>However, as the RMC slowly learned that more people than originally thought were imprinted and wanted education and training, the RMC decided to open additional Academies around the world. They began with another Academy in Turkey, and then introduced yet another to India.</p>
        <p>To this day, there are 21 Academies worldwide: four in Europe (including the original in England), five in Asia, two in Australia, four in Africa, three in South America, and three in North America. Each one was begun by the Roteland Magical Committee, and the RMC still owns and operates almost all of the Academies to this day.</p>
        <p>Breton Academy of Magic, located in Alderville, Maine, USA, was founded in 1732, although it was originally called Roteland Magician’s Academy – America. In 1784, shortly after the American Revolution, imprinted members of the Alderville community realized a new need for powers in the “modern” world: a coalition of individuals dedicated to goodwill and improving society.</p>
        <p>Up until the late 1700s, magic was used for mainly selfish purposes. It was used to entertain, make power-bearing individuals’ lives easier, and to claim fame. But the American Revolution presented a new thought process unbeknownest to the magical community: if America is pulling itself away from England politically, then perhaps, so could the magical community…</p>
        <p>And so, English and American alike came together to discuss a bargaining deal (there was no gory war in the magical community). After four weeks of negotiating and debating, a final decision was agreed upon. The summary of the eight page agreement is as follows:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>A new branch of the Roteland Magical Committee is allowed to develop <em>under</em> the original RMC. This new branch  will be headquartered in Maine, USA. This new branch will be in charge of operating, funding, and staffing <em>only</em> Roteland Magician’s Academy – America in Maine, and they may rename their branch and Academy as they desire. The new branch is allowed to develop and grow as needed, but will always remain a part of the greater Roteland Magical Committee.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The new branch of the RMC that developed became what is known now as Breton Alliance, Inc. (BAI). Today, BAI has grown and developed to employ even more imprinted individuals than the original Roteland Magical Committee, and BAI has multiple locations around the world. Roteland Magician’s Academy – America has now become Breton Academy of Magic, and is the most prestigious and well-known Academy worldwide, except for the original Roteland Magician’s Academy in England.</p>
        <p>Lastly, we never forget to properly attribute our roots to the Roteland Magical Committee. That’s where we started, and they’re still the ones who call the shots. Don’t go around bad-mouthing them either… every now and then, a member of the RMC will visit Alderville to check up on us and to make sure we remember who’s in charge.</p>
